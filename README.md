# Tiny Escapes
Tiny Escapes is my submission for [Fall-O-Ween Jam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/soj-uob), organised by
[Level Up UK](https://lvlup.org.uk).

It's a fast-paced platformer where the player must repeatedly escape a single-screen room against the clock,
but each time you escape the room, the rules of the game change!

## This repository
This repository contains the source code for a post-jam version of the game. Since the original jam version,
I have fixed some bugs and made improvements to the UI, amongst other minor changes.

I am continuing to develop the game (with Tiny Escapes as a working title), but I am not making the code I
write from this point onwards public.

## Building the game
A desktop build can be created by running `gradlew desktop:dist`. The jar file will be created in the
`desktop/build/libs/` directory.
